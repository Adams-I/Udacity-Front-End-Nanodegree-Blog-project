                        Today, I had to make a very painful decision which was not to fly to South Africa from Israel for my nephew’s wedding taking place on Sunday. 
                        My flight tonight has not been cancelled by ELAL, and a very strong part of me is desperate not to miss out on this monumental event in my nephew’s life.
                        I was there when he was born, I was his godmother at his Brit Mila and I have been adamant that I will be at his wedding.

                        In this week’s Torah reading, we read about the Jewish people being counted. 
                        Each person had to give a half a shekel and in the end all the money was counted and they knew how many people there were. 
                        Why half a shekel? Why not a full shekel? And, isn’t it ironic that globally we are counting people and watching statistics....

                        It’s nearly impossible to have a conversation about technology without mentioning artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML).
                        These terms are cropping up everywhere in conversations about how tech is changing the world and streamlining our lives. 
                        However, AI and ML are often used interchangeably, making the difference between the two even less clear.

                    Self-driving cars are no longer just a part of science fiction movies. If you visit San Francisco, odds are you will see a self-driving car from Uber or Cruise roaming the streets with a supervisor sitting behind the wheel, of course.
                    Tesla has been selling cars with self-driving capabilities for years. 
                    Their Autopilot feature can “steer, accelerate and brake automatically” and even be summoned within a parking lot.

                  If you’ve just started learning web development, you’ll probably have heard a lot of talk about frontend and backend programming. 
                  But what exactly do we mean by this? If you’re a beginner in the field, it can be hard to know not only which is which, but also what is covered by one or the other.
